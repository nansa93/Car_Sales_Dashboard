# Car Sales Dashboard

## Introduction

Designing and creating an interactive, dynamic dashboard for car sales using Power BI is the aim of this project.
We will be able to understand our sales success over time and make data-driven decisions using the dashboard's visualization of important KPIs related to our car sales.

## Tools Used 

- Power BI
   - Data cleaning
   - Data Analysis
   - Data Visualization
 
## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following task:
 1. Data Loading and inspection.
 2. Handling Missing Values.
 3. Eliminating all blank values and anomalies.
 4. Data Cleaning and Formating.

## Problem statement  1:  KPI's Requirment
The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to our sales data. 
This will help us with the process of making well-informed decisions, tracking our progress, and recognizing patterns and possibilities for development.

1. Sales Overview:
   - Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales
   - Previous-Year-to-Date (PYTD) Total Sales
   - Sales Difference
   - Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales
   - Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales

2. Average Price Analysis
   - YTD Average Price
   - Previous-Year-to-Date (PYTD) Average Sales
   - Average Price Difference
   - YOY Growth in Average Price
   - Month-to-Date (MTD) Average Price

3. Cars Sold Metrics:
   - Year-to-Date (YTD) Cars Sold
   - Previous-Year-to-Date (PYTD) Cars Sold
   - Cars Sold Difference
   - Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Cars Sold
   - Month-to-Date (MTD) Cars Sold

## Problem Statement 2: Charts Requirement

1. YTD Sales Weekly Trend:
   - Display a line graph that shows the YTD sales trend by week. Weeks be presented on the X-axis, and the total sales amount be displayed on the Y-axis.

2. YTD Total Sales by Body Style:
   - Visualize the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Donut chart.

3. YTD Total Sales by Color:
   - Using a treemap, show how different car colors have contributed to the YTD total sales..

4. YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region:
   - Showcase the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a map to visualize the sales distribution geographically.

5. Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form:
   - Provide a tabular grid that displays the sales trend for each company. The grid should showcase the company name along with their YTD sales figures.
